# Logisim Circuit Snippets

A collection of funny, nerdy circuits for [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/). These digital circuits have been written during my course in *Structured computer organization* (1st Semester, 2014) based on the reference work from Andrew S. Tanenbaum.

### Hamming Distance

Calculates the hamming distance of two 4-bit input codes.

### 4-Bit ALU

Chained 1-bit ALUs to calculate basic operations (add, sub, not, neg, inc, and, or, true, false) on two half-byte inputs.
